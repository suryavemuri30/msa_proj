# Microservices Project - Product, Inventory, and Order Management

This project is a microservices-based application developed using *Spring Boot* and *Spring Cloud*. It consists of three main microservices:

- **Product Service**: Manages product details.
- **Inventory Service**: Manages inventory and stock availability.
- **Order Service**: Manages orders and checks inventory before placing an order.

### Additional Components
- **Eureka Server**: Service registry for dynamic service discovery.
- **API Gateway**: Centralized entry point for routing requests to the microservices.

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Cloud OpenFeign, Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka, Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **REST Client**: Postman or any other tool

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- JDK 17+

## ðŸ“¦ API Endpoints via API Gateway (http://localhost:8084)

### 1. Product Service

| Method | Endpoint                   | Description                |
|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| GET    | /product-service/products        | Get all products           |
| GET    | /product-service/products/{id}   | Get product by ID          |
| POST   | /product-service/products        | Create a new product       |
| PUT    | /product-service/products/{id}   | Update an existing product |
| DELETE | /product-service/products/{id}   | Delete a product           |
| GET    | /product-service/products/sku/{skuCode} | Check for product by SKU |

#### Sample Product JSON
```json
{
    "name": "iPhone 13",
    "description": "Latest Apple iPhone",
    "price": 999.99,
    "quantity": 50
}
```

---

### 2. Inventory Service

| Method | Endpoint                      | Description                      |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| GET    | /inventory-service/inventory            | Get all inventory items          |
| GET    | /inventory-service/inventory/{id}       | Get inventory by ID              |
| POST   | /inventory-service/inventory            | Create new inventory             |
| DELETE | /inventory-service/inventory/{id}       | Delete inventory item            |
| POST   | /inventory-service/inventory/stock      | Check stock availability         |

#### Check Stock Availability
```http
POST /inventory-service/inventory/stock?skuCode=iphone_13&quantity=10
```

---

### 3. Order Service

| Method | Endpoint                  | Description                |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| GET    | /order-service/orders        | Get all orders             |
| GET    | /order-service/orders/{id}   | Get order by ID            |
| POST   | /order-service/orders        | Create a new order         |
| DELETE | /order-service/orders/{id}   | Delete an order            |

#### Sample Order JSON
```json
{
    "skuCode": "iphone_13",
    "quantity": 5
}
```

## ðŸ“š How It Works

1. **Create a Product**: Add products using the Product Service.
2. **Add Inventory**: Use the Inventory Service to set stock levels.
3. **Place an Order**: The Order Service uses OpenFeign to check inventory before placing the order.
4. **Stock Check**: Inventory Service verifies if the requested quantity is available.
5. **Order Validation**: Only allows orders if enough stock is present.
6. **Product Validation**: Only allows orders if the product exists.
7. **API Gateway**: Routes all requests through a centralized endpoint (`http://localhost:8084`).
8. **Eureka Server**: Manages service registration and discovery.

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

1. **Postman**: Use the provided endpoints through the API Gateway (`http://localhost:8084`) to test each service.

---

## ðŸ›¡ Error Handling

- **404 Not Found**: When the product or inventory is not found.
- **400 Bad Request**: When trying to create an order with insufficient stock.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Issues with service communication or gateway.

---

## ðŸ”— Communication Between Services

- **OpenFeign Client** (`InventoryClient`) is used in the Order Service to call the Inventory Service.
- **OpenFeign Client** (`ProductClient`) is used in the Order Service to call the Product Service.
- **Eureka Server** enables dynamic service discovery for the API Gateway and all microservices.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements

- Implement Circuit Breaker with **Resilience4J**.
- Integrate with **Kafka** for async communication.
- Add **Swagger** for API documentation.
- Improve API Gateway with **rate-limiting** and **security features**.

---

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

If you encounter the error:
```
TransportException: Cannot execute request on any known server
```

### Possible Solutions:
1. **Eureka Server Not Running**:
   - Ensure the Eureka Server is running on `http://localhost:8761`.

2. **Incorrect Eureka Server URL in `application.properties`**:
```properties
eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka
```

3. **Cross-Service Communication Issues**:
   - Make sure all services are registered in Eureka.
   - Check that the API Gateway is properly routing requests.

4. **Clear Cache and Rebuild**:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
