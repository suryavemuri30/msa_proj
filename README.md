# Microservices Project - Product, Inventory, and Order Management

This project is a microservices-based application developed using *Spring Boot* and *Spring Cloud OpenFeign*. It consists of three microservices:

- *Product Service*: Manages product details.
- *Inventory Service*: Manages inventory and stock availability.
- *Order Service*: Manages orders and checks inventory before placing an order.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- *Backend*: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Cloud OpenFeign
- *Database*: MySQL
- *Build Tool*: Maven
- *REST Client*: Postman or any other tool

## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- JDK 17+
- Maven
- IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, or any other)


### Build and Run Each Service

#### 1. Product Service
bash
cd product-service
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run

- Runs on http://localhost:8080

#### 2. Inventory Service
bash
cd ../inventory-service
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run

- Runs on http://localhost:8082

#### 3. Order Service
bash
cd ../order-service
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run

- Runs on http://localhost:8081

## ðŸ“¦ API Endpoints

### 1. Product Service (http://localhost:8080)

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| GET    | /products      | Get all products           |
| GET    | /products/{id} | Get product by ID          |
| POST   | /products      | Create a new product       |
| PUT    | /products/{id} | Update an existing product |
| DELETE | /products/{id} | Delete a product           |
| GET    | /products/sku/{skuCode} | To check for product|

#### Sample Product JSON
json
{
    "name": "iPhone 13",
    "description": "Latest Apple iPhone",
    "price": 999.99,
    "quantity": 50
}

### 2. Inventory Service (http://localhost:8082)

| Method | Endpoint              | Description                      |
|--------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| GET    | /inventory          | Get all inventory items          |
| GET    | /inventory/{id}     | Get inventory by ID              |
| POST   | /inventory          | Create new inventory             |
| DELETE | /inventory/{id}     | Delete inventory item            |
| POST   | /inventory/stock    | Check stock availability         |

#### Check Stock Availability
http
POST /inventory/stock?skuCode=iphone_13&quantity=10


---

### 3. Order Service (http://localhost:8081)

| Method | Endpoint       | Description                |
|--------|----------------|----------------------------|
| GET    | /orders      | Get all orders             |
| GET    | /orders/{id} | Get order by ID            |
| POST   | /orders      | Create a new order         |
| DELETE | /orders/{id} | Delete an order            |

#### Sample Order JSON
json
{
    "skuCode": "iphone_13",
    "quantity": 5
}

## ðŸ“š How It Works

1. *Create a Product*: Add products using the Product Service.
2. *Add Inventory*: Use the Inventory Service to set stock levels.
3. *Place an Order*: The Order Service uses OpenFeign to check inventory before placing the order.
4. *Stock Check*: Inventory Service verifies if the requested quantity is available.
5. *Order Validation*: Only allows orders if enough stock is present.
6. *Product Validation*: Only allows orders if product exists.

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

1. *Postman*: Use the provided endpoints to test each service.


---

## ðŸ›¡ Error Handling

- *404 Not Found*: If product not found.
- *400 Bad Request*: When trying to create an order with insufficient stock.

---

## ðŸ”— Communication Between Services

- *OpenFeign Client* (InventoryClient) is used in the Order Service to call the Inventory Service.
- *OpenFeign Client* (ProductClient) is used in the Order Service to call the Product Service.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements

- Add Eureka Service Registry for dynamic service discovery.
- Implement Circuit Breaker with Resilience4J.
- Integrate with Kafka for async communication.
- Add Swagger for API documentation.
